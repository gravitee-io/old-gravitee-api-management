# Integration tests with Cypress

This folder contains the integration tests of Gravitee.io API Management.

They are based on Cypress and can be run against a locally running APIM Rest API.


## Getting Started

First you need to install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Then, the following NPM scripts are available:
 - `npm run test`: Opens the Cypress Test Runner to run tests against a locally running APIM Rest API  
 - `npm run test:ci`: Run integration tests with Cypress against a locally running APIM Rest API
